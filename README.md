What is this?
-----------------

A collection of php oriented object classes that use the PSR-0 convention.

In universe, every top level directory represents a planet (also called vendor in some other nomenclatures).


But
------

The universe has collapsed, and was reborn, its components are dispatched all over the place, expanding.
The universe as [we](https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe/) know doesn't exist anymore, long live the universe.
