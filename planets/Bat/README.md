Bat (Basic Tools) is an ensemble of basic tools that one can use to 
hopefully do a job faster (from the coding point of view, not performance).

A tool is a **static class**, which means that you can call its methods
without having to instantiate it.





So far, the Bat library is composed of the following tools:



Tools       |       Description
----------- | -----------------------
[FileSystemTool]( https://github.com/lingtalfi/universe/blob/master/planets/Bat/FileSystemTool.md )          |       Tools for the filesystem.
